For instance, you can restrict pods to pull container images from certain registries or disallow containers to run in privileged mode. In addition, admission controllers can enforce label naming conventions or add annotations, such as a cost center to objects.
The admission controllers intercept requests made to the API server before the persistence of the object.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Authentication</title><link>https://foreops.com/blog/kubernetes-authentication/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 13:12:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://foreops.com/blog/kubernetes-authentication/</guid><description>This post will discuss authentication methods for two types of accounts that access the Kubernetes cluster: users and machines. While cluster administrators and application developers require access to the cluster to manage and deploy applications respectively, machines, processes, and applications also need access to the cluster, which they obtain through the service accounts.
User Authentication Kubernetes does not have objects which represent user accounts. Users do not log in, and there are no sessions or timeouts.</description></item></channel></rss>
